# Student_Management_System
The aim of the project is to build a Student Management System using Hibernate Framework and GUI Swings in Java
Hibernate is an open source source, lightweight framework for ORM (Object Relational Mapping)
This management system allows us to add, view, update and delete the students which will help the faculty to store the information of the students.
This system will also help us to show the performance of the students using charts (like a bar graph).
